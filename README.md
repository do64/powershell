# PowerShell
This repo contains anything potentially useful I've written in PowerShell.


### which.ps1 ###
Written to add to my PowerShell $profile to roughly replicate something like the 'which' command on \*nix systems. This is essentially just a wrapper for the Get-Command cmdlet. Output is simplified compared to Get-Command.
