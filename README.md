# PowerShell
Public PowerShell stuff I've written.

### Set-TaskbarVisibility.ps1 ###
Toggles taskbar visibility if no argument is provided. Parameter 'Visibility' can be added to explictly set the taskbar as either 'Visible' or 'Autohide'.

### which.ps1 ###
Written to add to my PowerShell $profile to roughly replicate something like the 'which' command on \*nix systems. This is essentially just a wrapper for the Get-Command cmdlet. Output is simplified compared to Get-Command.
